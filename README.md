# data science coding samples

Customize implement two classification algorithms of convolutional neural network and decision tree with adaboosting.

## About the projects

Two python file is in the src folder. One is to classify the dogs and cats using convolutionall neural network. The input is images with labels -- dog or cat. Another one is to classify the mushrooms using decision tree with adaboosting. The input is mushrooms with features and labels -- the quality of mushrooms is good or not.

## How to Run

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ShaotingZhang/data_science_coding_samples
cd src
python Dogs-and-cats.py
python Decision_tree.py
```

### Package dependencies

You may have an issue with running some packages, you may need to install them.

```shell
pip install numpy
pip install tensorflow
pip install opencv-python
pip install tflearn
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
