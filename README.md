# data science coding samples

Customized implementions of two classification algorithms: convolutional neural network and decision tree with adaboosting.

## About the projects

Two python files in the src folder. 
1) Dogs-and-cats.py: classify the dogs and cats using convolutionall neural network. The input is images with labels -- dog or cat. 
2) Decision_tree.py: classify the mushrooms using decision tree with adaboosting. The input is mushrooms with features and labels -- each label denotes whether the quality of mushrooms is good or not.

## How to Run

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ShaotingZhang/data_science_coding_samples
cd src
python Dogs-and-cats.py
python Decision_tree.py
```

### Package dependencies

```shell
pip install numpy
pip install tensorflow
pip install opencv-python
pip install tflearn
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
```
